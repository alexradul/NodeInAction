Design and management tool for business it system development. 

Ovo što oni nude je project management alat, sa jako puno opcija i mogućnosti. 

When it comes to modeling, it is not that user friendly. 

Code is preserved during generation, but overal user experience is not that good. 
Structure of the packages is not (easily) visible, editor lacks tagged values support - relies only on steretypes. 

Model you create here is very bound to the implementation: you have to define getters and setters if you want them generated, you have to specify a plenty of implementation level details if you want to generate hibernate mappings, like details of the database connection, driver used, etc. 

Design and management tool for business it system development. 

Bad user experience. 

Modeling is not easy. In order to specify elements' attributes you have to click too much. These property values are not directly visible when navigating model. Model navigability is questionable. 

Java code generated from the model is not really usefull. Association support is poor. Documentation is not generated from the model. 

Overall expirience: even though set of features is very rich, using this tool is not easy. Also, it features quite different scope of responsibilities - it may be compared to the sum of several quite successfull tools from the market, featuring completely different responsibilities: project management and tracking, modeling, team work, etc. However, when it comes to easiness of use and applicability of the generated code, it is very questionable. 

Documentation: Has a large number of tutorials and different materials on the web site.

MDD Toolkit improvement: 

Settings for code generation can be interesting to review: there are plenty of them.
